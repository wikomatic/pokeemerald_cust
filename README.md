# About this branch
This is a decapitalized (all-caps text replaced with proper capitalization) version of the [**pokeemerald**](https://travis-ci.org/pret/pokeemerald) dissasembly, originally made by [**Wyrserth**](https://github.com/Wyrserth) and adapted to the current structure of the project.

As the disassembly continues to develop, I'll try to keep up this branch as updated as possible.

It builds the following ROM:

* pokeemerald.gba `sha1: 8C19F2555E10DFF32A9914CEAC360B018AF42E6C`

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
